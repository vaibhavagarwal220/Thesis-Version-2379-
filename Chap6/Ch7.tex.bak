\section{Observations and Remarks}

This dissertation is concerned with the development of novel numerical approaches, which can be used for various complex multi-physics fluid interface problems. Firstly, vortex shedding phenomena is investigated for laminar, unsteady flow past a rotationally oscillating circular cylinder. N-S equations are solved using recently developed HOC scheme on a body fitted, non-uniform polar grid in such a way that surface of the cylinder forms the inner boundary of the domain. Then, a new modified HOC based finite difference scheme is developed in polar coordinates to solve elliptic PDEs in domains with discontinuities due to the presence of circular interfaces, which is then extended to N-S equations for simulating flow past a circular cylinder. Body fitted, non-uniform polar grid in constructed in such a way that surface of the cylinder is considered as an interface immersed in the fluid. This is a generalized approach to solve flow past cylinders as it can also take into account thermal and mass transfer characteristics, in addition to the material properties of the bluff bodies like porosity, solidity etc. The most significant contribution of this work, however, is the development of a new generalized finite difference scheme for solving problems with arbitrary shaped fixed and moving interfaces on a uniform cartesian grid. This scheme is extended to solve incompressible, 2D Stokes flows. All the schemes are employed to different complex physical flow situations to examine their accuracy, efficiency and robustness. Extensive validation exercise is carried out by comparing the results obtained from the schemes with existing analytical, numerical and experimental results. In what follows, first the work carried out in the thesis is described briefly so that insightful comments can be made on it earlier.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Scheme 1}: An HOC scheme for $\psi-\omega$ formulation of the N-S equations is extended to solve the flow past a rotationally oscillating circular cylinder problem on non-uniform polar grids for $Re$ ranging from 150 to 500. The study provides insight into the wake characteristics associated with vortex shedding phenomena from the cylinder due to fluid-structure interactions and consolidates previous related observations, often unaccounted for, found in the published literature.

\item \emph{Scheme 2}: A new modified HOC based finite difference scheme in developed in polar coordinates to solve general PDEs in domains with discontinuities due to the presence of circular interfaces on a non-uniform polar grid. Non-uniform space grid is constructed in such a way that the grid points cluster around the point of discontinuity and the points of discontinuity (or the interface) is not a node. Grid points are so clustered that the interval formed by two points on either side of the discontinuity (irregular points) acts almost like one single point. Number of test problems on elliptic PDE's are solved with different level of complexities to validate the scheme. All these studies confirm that the scheme is second order accurate and it produces overall better results than many other well-known methods available in the literature. The robustness of this scheme is gauged from its successful implementation on the flow past an impulsively started circular cylinder where all the flow characteristics including the von K$\acute{\rm a}$rm$\acute{\rm a}$n vortex street are accurately captured. Moreover, the simulations are extremely close to the experimental results.

\item \emph{Scheme 3}: In a significant development, a new generalized finite difference scheme for solving problems in domains with arbitrary shaped interfaces on a uniform cartesian grid is introduced. Numerical tests are carried out to validate the scheme for solving elliptic equations in two and three dimensions. Three elliptic problems in two dimensions with different shapes of the interface, ie. circular, ellipse and star shaped, are considered to validate the scheme. Two different examples with a spherical interface immersed in a cubic domain are considered for validation in three dimensions. The scheme is then extended to solve incompressible, two dimension Stokes flows. Three different examples are considered in which the interface is chosen as a unit circle and the analytic solution is known under different situations. It produces excellent results for pressure term even if in a coarser grid like $32 \times 32$, and the results are significantly better than those of existing methods. Linear regression analysis is used to find order of accuracy of the scheme using grid refinement which shows that the proposed scheme has average second order accuracy.

\item \emph{Scheme 4}: Next, the new finite difference idea (Scheme 3) is extended to solve problems with discontinuities across a time dependent moving interface. An unsteady, non linear general partial differential equation and Stefan's problem are solved with a moving interface in 1D. In 2D, heat equation is considered on a square domain with a circular interface whose radius is continuously changing with time. The scheme shows nearly second order accuracy and good agreement with the analytical solution is seen.

The work therefore, achieves with great success the major objectives set at the beginning, namely the modification of some existing HOC algorithms to broaden their applicability and development of new algorithms for solving problems in domains with arbitrary shaped, fixed and deformable interfaces in both polar and cartesian grids. In what follows the major achievements of the thesis will be highlighted in the form of observations and comments, further substantiating the claim of objectives having been achieved.

\item The implementation of HOC scheme to laminar, incompressible flow past a rotationally oscillating circular cylinder can be easily extended to compressible flows making it possible to handle the primitive variable formulation of the N-S equations. The boundary conditions developed for laminar flows can be extended to shear flows over the bluff bodies. In most of the practical cases, flows approaching the bluff bodies are not uniform but sheared. Moreover, vortex shedding disappears after a sufficiently large value of shear parameter. This broadens the scope of the applicability of HOC scheme.

\item Flow problems involving discontinuous coefficients and singular source terms is an interesting area of research to which much effort is currently being directed. However, HOC scheme for such problems are seen only for 1D equations. Scheme 2 developed here applies to 2D elliptic PDEs with a successful extension to N-S equations on a non uniform polar grid. The scheme is seen to accurately capture all the flow characteristics including the von K$\acute{\rm a}$rm$\acute{\rm a}$n vortex street. Significantly, the scheme has potential to consider the properties like porosity, solidity so that characteristics like heat transfer, mass transfer etc can be investigated for flow past bluff bodies and is therefore an important development.

\item The development of a new generalized finite difference scheme for solving problems with arbitrary shaped interfaces on a uniform cartesian grid is an important addition to the already existing methodologies for simulating fluid interface problems in CFD. The scheme is able to handle merging and break-up of the interface. This approach has a direct extension to interface tracking methods which can simulate motion of deforming elastic membranes, rising bubbles in liquids, deformation of drops under shear flows, tracking melting front of ice in water etc. which is indeed a major achievement.

\item The versatility of this new scheme can be realized from the accurate computation of problems in domains with discontinuities across a time dependent moving interface. Solution of Stefan's problem in 1D broadens the scope of its direct extension in 2D and 3D to simulate models of ice melting, glaciation etc.

\section{Scope for Future Work}
The finite difference algorithms developed in this dissertation encompasses a large number of real-life physical phenomena having a great importance in diverse industrial applications. Following are the probable areas that could be taken up in future.

\begin{itemize}
\item As mentioned earlier, this work makes it possible to handle pressure poisson equation arising in primitive variable form of N-S equations. Moreover, the boundary conditions developed for laminar flows can be extended to more complex flow phenomena like shear flows over the cylinders.

\item The new immersed interface ideas developed can be easily extended to heat transfer and mass transfer aspects for flow around cylinders. These characteristics are of considerable interest in many industrial applications such as in operation performance of cooling towers, chimneys, heat exchangers, and cooling of electronic components and equipments.

\item The schemes developed can be extended to simulate flows over aeronautical bodies such as airfoils; non-aeronautical, bluff and semi-streamlined bodies such as cars and bridges; motion of fishes in water, insect or bird flights etc. Each one of these are an important area of research.

\item The schemes developed opens up the possibility of their extension to the efficient solution of incompressible flows with moving interfaces. One of them is fluid flexible-body structures for example simulating viscous pulsatile flow in an arterial stenosis. Such a biological application would allow us to obtain useful information which may lead to early detection, prevention and diagnosis of various cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke.

\item Existing schemes are developed on finite difference setup only, but possible attempts can be made to develop the schemes based on similar idea with some modifications, on finite volume setup. This may further broaden the applicability.
